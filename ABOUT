MECHANIED ASSAULT AND EXPLORATION RELOADED is based on INTERPLAY's
MECHANIED ASSAULT AND EXPLORATION from 1996. M.A.X. Reloaded is a
completly rewritten clone based on the wish of many M.A.X. fanatics
to play M.A.X. bugless in multiplayer mode over the Internet using
TCP/IP. M.A.X. Reloaded code is based on Michael Moench's "MM's 
M.A.X.". MM offered the source to the community of maxthegame.de
since he had no time for his project any more. 2007 the community
decided to go opensource with it and started the M.A.X. Reloaded
project. M.A.X. Reloaded is released under the GPLv2. See COPYING 
for details.
