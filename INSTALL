PREREQUISITES

You'll need to have these libraries (with equivalent devel versions
for building) to play M.A.X. Reloaded:

 libsdl1.2
 libsdl-mixer1.2 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-net

SDL libraries can be found at http://www.libsdl.org

WINDOWS

Download the required SDL-libraries and install them to your system32
directory - e.g. c:\windows\system32

http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.12-win32.zip
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL_mixer-1.2.8-win32.zip
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/release/SDL_net-1.2.7-win32.zip

Now unrar MAX-Reloaded_-x.y.z.rar to a folder of your choise - e.g.
C:\Program Files\

After installing currently needed original gamedata you can 
start M.A.X. Reloaded executing Max-Reloaded.exe

LINUX

Due the copyright we are not allowed to provide any game content
from the original Mechanized Assault and Exploration (c) 1996 Interplay

MAXR is currently in need of unofficial gfx data and WILL NOT start
without the required files. Due the copyright we are not allowed to
provide you with the missing files. You have to get the files for
yourself and copy them to their proper locations. Please check the
bbs at maxthegame.de/bbs for more informations.

If you do own an original Mechanized Assault & Exploration CD
(c) 1996 Interplay or if you downloaded the original game from
cdosabandonware you can however make use of the tool resinstaller
and extract the needed gfx automagically from your existing max.res

If you don't own an original maxcd you've another chance in downloading
Mechanized Assault and Exploration from cdosabandonware.com since you
won't find any gamecds from this any more on stores - too old.

This version is however lacking some files like videos, music and some
sounds.

TROUBLESHOOTING

Compilation problems on 64bit and/or ppc:

Not supported yet, sorry.

Compilation problems:

If you compile from source and get errors about mix_chunk try upgrading
your SDL and SDL_mixer installation. We experienced this problems on
SDL_mixer prior 1.2.8.

Screenresolution:

It is possible to increase the resolution in MAX.XML however
you should keep in mind that all menus and displays are designed for
640x480. If you experience odd graphical problems (and there are!)
you're on your own.

Sound:

If you experience problems with soundquality (especially on WinXP) you
may increase the chunksize in MAX.XML. Default is 1024 and 2205Hz. Next
proper value is 2048 or 4096. If you increasing frequency you have to 
increase the chunksize, too. However inceasing frequency has only a
small benefit to the backgroundmusic.

Maps:

The mapeditor from MM's Max is (currently) not included. The orignal
maps are however 100% compatible.

Known Bugs:

Many. Multiplayer does NOT work. HotSeat does. There is no AI! For more
known and/or fixed bugs please visit our bugtracker:
