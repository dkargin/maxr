PREREQUISOTES

You'll need to have these libraries (with equivalent devel versions) to
build M.A.X. Reloaded:

 libsdl1.2
 libsdl-mixer1.2 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-net

SDL libraries can be found at http://www.libsdl.org

WINDOWS

Download the required SDL-libraries and install them to your system32 directory - e.g. c:\windows\system32

http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.12-win32.zip
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL_mixer-1.2.8-win32.zip
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/release/SDL_net-1.2.7-win32.zip

Now unzip max-x.y.z.zip to a folder of your choise - e.g.
C:\Program Files\MAX Reloaded\

After installing currently needed original gamedata you can 
start M.A.X. Reloaded executing MAX.EXE

LINUX

Due the copyright we are not allowed to provide any game content
from the original Mechanized Assault and Exploration (c) 1996 Interplay

We can only provide you with dummy-files so you can see where files
from an original gamecd belong. We're going to write an install
script for easy installing the needed files in our game structure.

If you don't own an original maxcd you've another chance in downloading
Mechanized Assault and Exploration from cdosabandonware.com since you
won't find any gamecds from this any more on stores - too old.

TROUBLESHOOTING

Resolution:

It is possible to increase the resolution in MAX.XML however
you should keep in mind that all menus and displays are designed for
640x480. If you experience odd graphical problems you're on your own.

Sound:

If you experience problems with soundquality (especially on WinXP) you
may increase the chunksize in MAX.XML. Default is 1024 and 2205Hz. Next
proper value is 2048 or 4096. Ih you increasing frequency you have to 
increase the chunksize, too. However inceasing frequency has only a
small benefit to the backgroundmusic.

Maps:

The mapeditor from MM's Max is (currently) not included. The old maps
are however 100% compatible. MM's Editor can still be used to create or
modify maps. Just save them on our maps folder and add 
an entry in maps.xml

Known Bugs:

Many. Multiplayer does NOT work. HotSeat does.
