PREREQUISITES

You'll need to have these libraries (with equivalent devel versions) to
build M.A.X. Reloaded:

 libsdl1.2
 libsdl-mixer1.2 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-net

SDL libraries can be found at http://www.libsdl.org

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure and 
makefiles. They are not in the SVN repository. Consequently, if you 
are building from SVN, you will have to set up these files on your
own (or simply configure a new c++/sdl project in the IDE of your
choice).

LINUX

	First untar the package:
	
	$ tar xfzv maxr-x.y.z.tar.gz
	
	Then change to the new directory:
	
	$ cd maxr-x.y.z
	
	Set up the Makefiles and create the configure scripts:
	
	$ ./bootstrap.sh
	
	If everything went well you should now be able to run ./configure
	and make. We highly recommend to run with --prefix=$HOME/games
	to install maxr to your homedirectory or something like that since
	maxr doesn't support homedirectorys yet and that way you can not
	install maxr systemwide without granting writepermissions to maxr
	game directory, max.xml config and save directory! Without these
	maxr will probably just crash during startup.
	
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install
	
	Compiles the maxr binary and installs it along with the game
	data to the default prefix which is probably /usr/local.

Rebuilding:

You should clean your existing maxr release build first with:

 $ make distclean

If you want to clean your maxr SVN build do:

 $ make maintainer-clean

Starting:

After installing currently needed original gamedata (see INSTALL) 
you can start M.A.X. Reloaded executing ./maxr in the datadirectory

If you don't want to install maxr simply move the new binary maxr
from src to the data directory. Now you can start M.A.X. Reloaded
executing ./maxr
