PREREQUISOTES

You'll need to have these libraries (with equivalent devel versions) to
build M.A.X. Reloaded:

 libsdl1.2
 libsdl-mixer1.2 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-net

SDL libraries can be found at http://www.libsdl.org

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure files. They
are not in the SVN repository. Consequently, if you are building from
SVN, you will need autoconf (>= 2.59) and automake (>= 1.9).

Sourcecode:

You can get it here:

WINDOWS


LINUX

First untar the package:

 $ tar xfzv max-x.y.z.tar.gz

then

 $ cd max-x.y.z

The usual

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ make install

only compiles the max binary and installs it along with the game
data to the default prefix which is probably /usr/local.

Rebuilding:

You should clean your existing max release build first with:

 $ make distclean

If you want to clean your max SVN build do:

 $ make maintainer-clean

Starting:

After installing currently needed original gamedata (see INSTALL) 
you can start M.A.X. Reloaded executing ./max in the gamedirectory
