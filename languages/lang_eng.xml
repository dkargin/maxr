		<Unit ID="1 20" ENG="Hangar">Hangar\n\nA hangar can repair damages, manufacture ammunition and refit ships with the newest technology. All of these operations require raw materials, hence hangars should be connected to stored raw materials.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 21" ENG="Land Mine">Land Mine\n\nA land mine is a small and hard to detect explosive device. Concealed under the ground and designed to destroy enemy targets while they pass over. Only surveyors, minelayers and infiltrators can spot mines. Once spotted, almost every damage will destroy it.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 22" ENG="Mining Station">Mining Station\n\nExtracts subterranean resources like raw materials, fuel and gold every turn. Buildings should be connected to a mining station to use the resources produced by it. If there is no storage building to store surplus resources, they'll be lost.\nAble to mine up to 16 resource units.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 23" ENG="Deep Mine">Deep Mine\n\nLike the normal mining station you can use it to extracts subterranean resources. The biggest advantage for this type of a mining station is the ability to extract up to [value] resource units.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 24" ENG="Landing Pad">Landing Pad\n\nLanding facility for planes. Does not repair or resupply planes. To resupply a plane on a landing pad, use a nearby supply truck or a repair unit.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 25" ENG="Water Platform">Water Platform\n\nProvides a surface over water on which you can construct other buildings. Engineers can build water platforms over the shore as well as open water. Water platforms are particularly important an island maps or when a valuable material deposit is under the bottom of the sea.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 26" ENG="Radar">Radar\n\nStationary, long-range radar. Longer-range units like missile launchers and artillery cannot fire on what they cannot see, so it's important to have a scanner or radar nearby.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 27" ENG="Research Center">Research Center\n\nIt examines how your units can be improved. Unlike upgrades purchased with credits, the research need time and the improvements are small. However research affects all of your units. In addition you can also research without a gold source. To operate a research center and a worker and power is required.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 28" ENG="Road">Road\n\nUnits move twice as fast over road squares.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 29" ENG="Sea Mine">Sea Mine\n\nA sea mine is a small and hard to detect explosive device. Concealed below sea level, designed to destroy enemy targets while they pass over. Only surveyors, minelayers and infiltrators (next to the coast) can spot mines. Once spotted, almost every damage will destroy it.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 30" ENG="Shield">Shield\n\nProtect building around it with a shield from enemy fire.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 31" ENG="Gold Vault">Gold Vault\n\nHolds gold. Mining stations produce gold every turn, if they have gold underneath them. To store unused gold, a mining station must be connected to a gold vault.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 32" ENG="Storage Unit">Storage Unit\n\nHolds raw materials. Mining stations produce raw materials every turn. To store more unused raw materials, a mining station should be connected to a storage unit.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 33" ENG="Fuel Tank">Fuel Tank\n\nHolds fuel. Mining stations produce fuel every turn. To store unused fuel, a mining station must be connected to a fuel tank.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 34" ENG="Training Hall">Training Hall\n\nTrains infiltrators who can disable or capture enemy units and infantry to guard against infiltrators. A training hall requires one worker from a habitat and power to operate.</Unit>
		<Unit ID="1 35" ENG="Eco-sphere">Eco-sphere\n\nIf you'll win via points, your primary goal should be to construct as many as possible Eco-spheres. Each Eco-sphere gives you one point per turn.\n\nDefend your Eco-spheres well, because if one is destroyed, you'll lose all the points it generated for you!\nEach Eco-sphere need one worker of a habit and power to operate.</Unit>
