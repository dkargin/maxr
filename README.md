# Building MAXR

## Supported Platforms

* Mac OS X
* MS Windows
* Linux

Other UNIX-like operating systems may work too out of the box. Chances are huge if there's a build of SDL2 and CMake for the system.

You can find more information about how to build maxr in our Wiki:

# Playing with original graphics and sounds

Due the copyright we are not allowed to provide any game content
from the original Mechanized Assault and Exploration (c) 1996 Interplay

If you do own an original Mechanized Assault & Exploration CD
(c) 1996 Interplay you can however make use of the tool *resinstaller*
and install the original gfx automagically from your existing M.A.X. copy.

Resinstaller also takes care of sounds, videos, maps and music.

The tool can be found on our website and easily installs and converts
the needed data for you. Please check the bbs at maxr.org for more
informations. When using the windows installer for maxr, the resinstaller
is also installed, and a Start Menu shortcut is available.

If you don't own an original M.A.X. CD but you want to play with the
original look'n'feel you can still buy it at Gog.com  
https://www.gog.com/game/m_a_x_m_a_x_2

Warning: Resinstaller will overwrite existing graphics. If you want to
keep existing free graphics for some reasons *backup* the folders fx,
gfx, vehicles and buildings. It's save to copy the files back after the
resinstaller has done it's magic.
